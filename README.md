# Peer to Peer Phone Calling with Peer.js

Playing with Snowpack, React and WebRTC. 

To get going, install dependencies (`yarn`) and run `yarn dev`.

To call somebody, get them to go to the same page and get them to send you their ID!

Very basic implementation with PeerJS in ~70 lines of JavaScript. 

I'd like to:
* Do some cool facial recognition stuff
* Implement cutsom backgrounds
* Add mute/unmute
* Support multiple peers
